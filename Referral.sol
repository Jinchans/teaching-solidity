// Referral program includes a referral mapping that tracks the referral codes of users and a referralCount mapping 
// that tracks the number of referrals each user has made. The contract also includes a signup function that allows 
// new users to sign up and receive a referral code. When a new user signs up, their referral code is added to the 
// referral mapping and their referrer's referralCount is incremented.
